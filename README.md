# House-Price-Prediction
The cost of housing is a significant indicator of economic expansion. Housing affordability is a significant social and economic problem that has caught the attention of policymakers, scholars, and urban planners worldwide. House prices are a significant indicator that should be carefully examined due to a variety of other co1. nsiderations.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is one of the most important part of any data science project and there are a number of things to be carried out in EDA. 

1. Handling missing values
2. Removing irrelevant columns
3. Outlier Handling

### Feature Engineering
Before beginning the model development phase, feature engineering is still another crucial stage. Feature engineering is the process of transforming unprocessed columns into useful features that may be ingested by a machine learning (ML) model. Because all ML models are built on matrix multiplication and optimization and because machines speak a language of numbers, we must translate the categorical columns into numerical characteristics.

1. One hot encoding
2. Creating new features
3. Splitting features and target variable
4. Scaling/normalizing the features
5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Model Building
1. Model fitting
2. Hyperparameter optimization
3. Ensemble methods
4. Models with reduced dimensions
5. Deep Learning Models
